# DiceRoller
Inspired by [abe's projects on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y_vFvCPHmE) and my ever-growing love to tabletop gaming, I decided to try building my own dice rolling gadget with components I already owned.
The gadget was built just temporarily on a breadboard as a proof of concept.

## Components used
- Genuino Uno
- LCD Screen LCM1602C
- six momentary push buttons
- 10k ohm potentiometer
- 220 ohm resistor
- 10 uF capacitor
- hook-up wires
- breadboard
